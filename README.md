# wes-favors-backend

This is the backend, created using Express, for WesFavors, a web-app which will allow Wesleyan students to accept and request favors from other students, either for free or at a price. For example, a student could ask if anybody would be willing to drive them to the airport at 5:00 a.m. on December 1 for $30. When a student accepts the favor, the requester will be sent a text with the acceptor's phone number, and the two students will discuss from there.
